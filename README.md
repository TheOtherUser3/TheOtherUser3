Hi, I'm Dawson.  
I am a Computer Science major at Boston University, with a preference for back-end development, and enjoy building complex, state driven systems. 

## Technical Focus
- Back-end programming and system design  
- Simulation and game logic  
- Web and mobile application development  

## Featured Projects

These are the three main projects that I am currently developing and are pinned in my profile.

### Cold War Simulator (Python)
A turn-based Cold War simulation being developed as an educational tool for my former high school history teacher, built to his client specifications, replacing its current pen-and-paper format.

**Core features include:**
- Event-driven game logic  
- Turn-based mechanics  
- Modular UI and game state systems  

**Target completion:** January 2026

### Snake Arena (Django, JavaScript, HTML)
A full-stack web application where users can:
- Create AI-controlled snakes  
- Design custom boards  
- Run automated snake battles  
- Evaluate performance and check leaderboards 

Built with Django for the backend and JavaScript for the frontend.

This project is currently maintained within an academic Django repo (`cs412`) due to course requirements.  
Within that repository, the Snake AI Arena is located in the `/project/` directory.

The repository also contains several earlier Django applications built throughout the semester. Although, since those are  
not personalized and not close to the scale of the Snake Arena application, they are not mentioned here.

**Planned future feature:** Snake evolution system  
Access it yourself here:

- Appointments  
- Contacts  
- Cleaning schedules

Built with:
- Kotlin  
- Jetpack Compose  

**Target completion:** December 2025
